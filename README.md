# Web App Engineer Assessment

For this project, you will be building the Movie Box Art Grid feature for our fictional These 
Movies Here site. This skeleton is built using CRA (Create React App), so make sure that you can 
install and run the site before getting started. The mocks for the feature are available via Zeplin
which you will receive an invitation for. All information and assets should be available to 
you via the Zeplin interface. Please take a moment to ensure that you can access the mocks.

You will be completing User Stories for this new feature. Work will be assessed based 
on completeness and quality of the individual users stories, not the number of stories completed.

You will have a 24-hour period to work through the stories, but you are only expected to spend 
about 2 hours on the project. After the 24-hour period has expired, you will lose access to the 
repository, therefore it is recommended that you commit changes to your repository often.

## Box Art Grid Feature

These Movies Here users need to be able to see all the movies available to them. For this feature, 
users should be presented with a grid of movies (or a list if on a smaller screen). Users should be 
able to search this list of movies by title or release date. They should also be able to change the 
sort view as well as add movies to a wishlist.

- [ ] **As a user** [Must be completed first]
  
  I want to see a list of all the movies available in a grid on larger screens and as a list on 
  smaller screens. I should have access to the name and release date of each movie in a hover over 
  state when in a grid view and next to the box art in a list view.

- [ ] **As a user**

  I want to be able to sort the list of movies displayed by either release date or by title in 
  ascending or descending order.

- [ ] **As a user**

  I want to be able to search the list of movies by either release date or title.

- [ ] **As a user**
  
  I want to be able to add and remove titles from my wishlist of movies.


- [ ] **As a user**
  
  I want to be able to change my view to only show movies added to my wishlist. I should also be 
  able to search within this list.


Please note that other than the required User Story, the rest can be finished in any order, but 
when moving on to a new story, you must take into account any previously completed features. 
For example, if you complete the sorting view feature, when you move on to search, the search 
results should reflect the currently selected sort by view. Also, the user should be able to change 
the sort view of the search results.
